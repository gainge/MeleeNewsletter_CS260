                        <p>
                            Genesis.  Let that sink in for a second...  Genesis, the tournament series that started it all, is back for round 3 -
                            This time bigger and better than ever.  With smash becoming an ever more popular among esports, it's grown significantly in terms of
                            both entrants and spectators.  Genesis 1 is looked back on as one of the scene's greatest tournaments, yet it only had 290 entrants for
                            melee.  Genesis 2 was about the same, and is perhaps even more memorable of an event.  Nowadays, 290 entrants is small talk, on
                            the national scale.  Big tournaments are almost expected to break 500, with many nationals inching past 1,000.  Genesis 3 blew
                            everything out of the water, surpassing 1,800 entrants for melee, and over 3,500 across all games.  Genesis 3 was my first out of
                            state tournament, and I had an absolute blast.  It's already being hailed by some as the greatest tournament of all time, or at least
                            the greatest in recent years.  What made is so special?
                        </p>



                        <p>
                            In a word, the history.  At Genesis 1 we saw our first glimpse of "The Beast From Sweden", aka Armada, as he tore through the bracket
                            with what was then seen as a mid-tier character, peach.  He and Mango (at the time maining puff) met in grand finals where The Kid
                            managed to defend American soil from Armada.  At Genesis 2, it was time for a rematch.  With Mango now primarily playing spacies,
                            and Armada coming into the event with a peach even further developed from what we'd seen at Genesis 1, the hype of this Grand Finals
                            was unprecedented.  At Genesis 2, however, Armada managed to solidly take the tournament over Mango.  Armada had secured himself as a
                            God of the game, and would continue to do so in the years following, and the era of the 5 Gods would unfold.

                        <p>
                            At any given tournament, Day 1 can elicit a range of emotions, from excitement (for those like me, who are simply pumped
                            to be in attendance), which is definitely a good thing, to nonchalance (like that of the top player, ready to plow through
                            his pool and go back to the hotel), which might not be as desirable. I'll admit, I was fully a part of the former category,
                            psyched out of my mind just to be entered in the tournament. The atmosphere in the venue is something else, you can tell that
                            you're helping be a part of smash history.

                        <p>
                            I think Genesis 3 did a great job of giving lower-level players this exhilarating experience, while at the same time not
                            making Day 1 pointless for top players. A few ways they did this were through 1) top 64 seeds getting a bye through Day 1,
                            2) Draft Crews taking place after singles pools, and 3) Most of doubles being completed during Day 1. Draft crews, if you
                            remember from Smash Summit, is when Top players select from a group of other top players to form a team, or crew. These
                            crews then compete in a single elimination bracket for a (relatively) small prize pool. At Genesis 3, Draft Crews was a
                            fun and exciting way to wrap up Day 1 that both pleased lower-level attendees, and gave top talent something worthwhile to do.

                        <p>
                            This is where things start to get interesting. With round 1 pools out of the way, top 3 in each pool advance to day 2
                            (RIP Judge, eliminated at 4th by a Marth Q_Q), and top 2 in each Round 2 pool advance to Top 64. For the top players,
                            this is the day when they get to work, for the layman smasher - it's the time of your life. Because of how absolutely
                            STACKED this tournament was (~90% of MIOM top 100), every other match seemed to be a must watch, even in R2 Pools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Round 2 pools gave us a slew of great sets, but top 64 was another beast altogether. I don't just say that because of
                            the talent that would be competing to make it to top 8, but because of the crazy efforts the Genesis TO staff went
                            through to ensure everyone got the best experience possible. For one thing, they decided to make every set in top 64
                            best of 5! That's over 120 sets, for those of you at home, what's more - Every set would be recorded and uploaded after
                            the tournament! So not only do we have an insanely stacked tournament that nearly every top player is attending, but we'll
                            be able to watch every Bo5 set in top 64! Heaven is real, and it's called Genesis.  Here are a few of my favorite sets:

                                    I was lucky enough to watch this set right next to the players, on the side stream, and it was great. If you watch
                                    the VOD, you can see me right there in the first row, and Lucky right behind me trying to get a good view, haha!
                                    Silentwolf is a veteran of the game, arguable the single most influential fox player in the 2007-2009 era, whereas
                                    Alex has been playing melee for a while, but has only recently shown that he has the skill to hang with the best. A
                                    fox ditto, this set was a battle of punishes and tech skill (Silentwolf) vs Mindgames and aggression (Alex), ultimately
                                    ending in a runaway win in the last game by Alex! Two hard reads on fox's recovery and Alex clinched the last game
                                    with a 2-stock. Alex would go on to beat wizzrobe as well, continuing his hot streak.

                                    Another set I had the pleasure of watching next to the setup, this set was memorable for me because of how it ended.
                                    Spoiler alert: N0ne takes the set, which is a huge upset, sending PewPewU to losers early. How did he win? By putting
                                    everything on the line in the last game by doing a wavedash off back air as falcon to hit PewPewU right as he's
                                    recovering. If he hits, he's a god, and wins the set - But if not? Poor falcon dies a terrible death to downtilts at
                                    the ledge. N0ne went all in, and made the highlight reel. Good stuff.

                                    SFAT! In the discussion for the best fox outside of the Gods, takes on the King! Jason Zimmerman himself. While this
                                    set was going on, I was in the back of the venue trying to catch Shroomed playing an east coast fox, milkman, but that
                                    didn't keep my eyes from being glued to the main stage. SFAT starts off by 4- stocking M2K's marth on Fountain! A
                                    4-stock to start of the set? The crowd goes wild. How does the King of the Mews respond? FD - Marth on Fox - reverse
                                    4-stock. Classic M2K moment. One grab and he's done, total domination. Unfortunately for the King, SFAT won the next
                                    2 games, clinching the upset over the God. One of my favorite memories from Genesis is watching Shroomed play, hearing
                                    murmurs of "4-stock...", "4- stock..." slowly build around me as the hometown hero ran a train on Mew2King.

                                    Back again with M2K, this time playing the game to get into top 8, losers side. Nintendude has been having the tournament
                                    of his life, beating the likes of Westballz and Shroomed earlier in bracket, but now he's facing the ultimate test. Down
                                    2 stocks to 1 in the 4th game, it look like Nintendude is going to
                                    have to take the loss and move on to game 5. But... He gets a grab. Wobbles him, and he's done. Stocks are tied. M2K has
                                    been playing extremely patiently, so this match is getting close to coming to time. Nintendude is reaching now, he knows
                                    his only chance is another wobble, but M2K isn't having it. In the midst of M2K's camping, Nintendude goes in to challenge
                                    for damage, and M2K is forced down to the ground. Capitalizing on this, Nintendude baits out a bad attack from Mew2King
                                    and strikes! Wobble, done. Back to back! Nintendude moves on to top 8! Just goes to show how a lead vs Ice Climbers is
                                    anything but.

                                    In a word, this set was crazy, and I'll tell you right now that Axe took it 3-1, putting himself into top 8, winners
                                    side. Every hit of this battle was hard, both players punishing for 50-60% if not
                                    death, and every game was neck and neck The defining moment of
                                    this set was in game 3, set count 1-1, where Axe was at high percent facing Mango with a clean stock. What happened next
                                    was perhaps the most clutch execution I've ever seen by a player when it mattered most. Axe gets a grab on falco
                                    by the edge, and his pikachu proceeds to cover every recovery option imaginable several times over, eventually winning
                                    the game and putting Axe up 2-1. Once Axe got his opening, you could feel it in the air... He was going to finish the
                                    stock. There was no other option! It had to happen! You didn't know how he would do it, or how likely it was, it was
                                    just going to happen. Because it's Genesis. Axe over Mango.

                            <p>
                                Mango is in losers, and up against Nintendude, the sleeper from yesterday who wobbled himself to top 8. Everyone
                                has had a little under a day to prepare for their finals matches, but what nobody could prepare for was waiting for
                                Nintendude in losers: Mango Fox. Like I mentioned earlier, Mango had been going almost exclusively Falco in the months
                                leading up to Genesis, I wish I could give you a solid number, but I want to say it's been almost 3 months since
                                Mango's fox has been used in bracket. What's more, he hadn't even been playing fox in any of his matches leading up to
                                Genesis top 8 - only Falco. Now the bird is gone, and Fox McCloud is here, and he's mad.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finals day in the civic center auditorium is electric. And I use that word in the most literal sense I have in my life,
                                you could feel the energy of the crowd around you, everything is that much more hype, everything matters that much more.
                                Right out the gates, Mango is looking hot, and I mean hot. The kid is cooking something fierce, and his play is showing
                                it. Mango's technicality in this first set was beyond anything I've seen in my whole life. His movement was unreal, after
                                just the first game I wanted to main fox, to be like Mango.  He's also using a different controller than the day before,
                                and is shield dropping like no one ever has in the history of the game. Silentwolf was sitting nearby us while we were
                                watching Mango play, and I hope he was taking notes, because Mango's tech skill and speed were next gen.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This set was an absolute clinic. Nintendude showed the day before that one grab is all it takes, but Mango showed Nintendude
                                 how it feels to play a mid-tier character. 3-0, 2 and 3 stocks all games. Nintendude got absolutely, fully, bodied. It was
                                 actually pretty disgusting, looking back at the vods. I've never seen another top player get dismantled so thoroughly by
                                 another top player. Nintendude truly looked like he wandered on stage and tried to play Mango. The Kid moves on.

                                Nintendude may have been a free win for Mango, but PPMD is a whole other ball game. Losing to Armada in winners, but still
                                looking really strong, PP is up against a Fox that looks unstoppable. We saw PP take a game off Armada Day 1 in crews, so
                                he's obviously playing well, how will he fare against Mango? 3-0, Mango. We see both Falco and Marth from PP, but neither
                                stand a chance against the storm that is losers Mango. After beating Nintendude, Mango doesn't even break stride as his
                                movement and tech skill overwhelms PPMD. Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a closer 3-0 than the last set, PP
                                definitely had his moments, but Mango was simply on another level. Sealing the set with a stylish wall jump back air, Mango
                                moves on to face his next challenge: Axe.

                                Axe, coming off of a brutal loss to Hungrybox in winners, one of pikachu's worst matchups in the game, beats SFAT in losers
                                to advance against Mango. Axe convincingly wins against SFAT 3-0, a surprising result considering SFAT's mastery of mid-tier
                                matchups due to years of playing Shroomed's Doc. Axe is looking hot, Mango has transcended - Let's get started.

                                This set is a runback from winners, but with a character switch from Mango, now utilizing his Fox over Falco. To Axe it's just
                                another spacie. You'd think that Axe would give Mango more trouble than Nintendude or PP, regardless of how hot Mango was
                                playing - but alas! Mango sweeps Axe and takes the set with another 3-0. Unfortunately for Axe, the last game ended in a
                                failed quick attack with Mango off stage, last stock. Perhaps if Axe hadn't have SD'd, the set count would've been different,
                                but at this point it looks like everything in the universe is pulling for Mango to make it to grands. However, one player
                                still stands in his way, and the last time they met things weren't pretty for the kid.

                                Hungrybox has just been sent to losers by Armada, 3-1, and now plays a seemingly unstoppable Mango. Can he defeat the kid,
                                and make it to grands for another Armada-Hbox finals? Not if destiny has anything to say about it. Game 1 starts off on
                                battlefield, and things are looking pretty even for the most part, until Mango gets thrown offstage on his last stock. We've
                                seen this 1,000 times, right? Hungrybox against a spacie offstage is death, no matter what the conditions, if you make it
                                back it's all luck. Hbox forces Mango below the stage, and goes in for a back air to secure the win, when........ What? Can
                                I see that again? Fox was below the stage, Jigglypuff goes down for an edge guard, and.... FOX wins?? What kind of shenanigans
                                are going on here?? Turns out (after watching the replay several times on youtube) Hungrybox misses his back air and drops
                                below the blast zone, dying off the bottom BEFORE Mango. The melee gods have smiled on the kid once again, the stars have
                                aligned and a Mango-Armada grand finals is looking like it could be a reality.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But, that's only the first game, Hungrybox is no slouch, and manages to win the second pretty convincingly. Fast forward
                                through the set, and we're tied 3-2. Mango has been hitting crazy reads on Hbox's aerial movement, as well as challenging
                                Puff on the ledge like no one every has, but Hbox has been punishing hard. Both of these players are at the top of the game.
                                Game 5 is on stadium, and on it rides the future of melee. Will we get another grand finals with Armada and Hungrybox,
                                something we've seen for nearly 4 tournaments straight? Or will the dream be realized, with Mango meeting Armada at Genesis.
                                As fate would have it, it's the latter. Mango takes game 5, tech skill never slowing down for an instant. The crowd is
                                deafening, everybody is on their feet. Now we find out what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

                                It's happening. Mango and Armada are playing in grand finals at Genesis, this is what everybody has been looking forward
                                to. Heck, if I didn't know better, I could've sworn I saw the hint of a smile on Hungrybox's face after Mango took their
                                set. This is melee.

                                Armada and Mango come at each other in a fox ditto on battlefield, a questionable matchup for Mango knowing Armada's
                                proficiency at the matchup. This is the player who picked up fox as a main less than a year ago, revolutionized the
                                character's meta, and instantly became the best to ever play him. But then, seemingly out of nowhere, Mango takes game 1.
                                Convincingly too! A 3-stock! On Armada's fox?? Whaaaaat the heck is going on? The greatest moment of this game was Mango
                                taking 2 stocks from Armada by shining him while starting his firefox. A kill setup that Armada has written his name all
                                over in the past 12 months. He "Armadas" Armada right into game 2.

                                Armada stays fox, and the flow of the game is heavily in Mango's favor. Mango is moving like a fiend, and seems to have
                                all the reads in the world. Game 2 isn't quite as one-sided as the first, but Mango still manages to 2-stock the beast
                                from Sweden. Mango is looking unstoppable, and Armada's fox is looking a little lost. What will his next move be?

                                The announcer's voice rings across the venue, and is met with a roar. Mango Armada grand finals, Peach
                                Fox.  THIS is genesis.  Let's go baby.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                With a breath of life, Armada surges and takes Game 3, preventing the bracket reset for the time being. After all his talk
                                about how Fox is the better character, and how Peach doesn't have as big a place in today's meta, it's his roots that bring
                                him the 'W' when it matters. However he's not out of the woods yet, Mango is quick to counter pick Yoshi's Story, where he
                                manages to stand his ground against the Peach he has so much history against. Then the unthinkable happens. Both players
                                last stock, Armada hits mango offstage, then somehow side-b's off the side of Yoshi's! A completely uncharacteristic flub
                                of techskill from the usually unflappable Armada. Mango quickly illusion's to ledge, and rolls up as peach parasols to the
                                blast zone. Armada drops the set with an SD, and everything on the planet seems to be pointing Mango to a win. In the words
                                of TKBreezy, "Bracket reset has been achieved."
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Set 2. Armada is set on Peach this time around, it looks like the Fox is securely on the back burner for this grand finals.
                                Things start off on a completely different note than the last set, with Armada taking Game 1 on dreamland solidly. Mango is
                                quick to respond, however, again taking armada to Yoshi's as a counter pick. Things are looking really solid for the kid,
                                up 2 stocks to 1 against peach, when he get hit by a nair, killing him off the side. No worries though, He has a fresh stock
                                and Armada is nearly at upsmash kill percent. But suddenly, Mango is offstage! He overextends in the corner and is promptly
                                thrown off the level, now in an edge guard situation. Mango looks to be able to sweetspot the ledge, but heartbreakingly
                                misses the angle, going straight sideways into the wall of Yoshi's Story. Armada goes up 2-0.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Mango runs it back, this time taking the game on Yoshi's, like he should've before, but now is at the disadvantage, because
                                he has to win 2 games in a row on Armada's counter pick: Final Destination. Peach has a chain grab on fox here, which
                                doesn't give a lot of hope to Norwalk's hero. Mango actually ends up doing surprisingly well, but ulimately drops the game,
                                and the set, against Armada. Armada takes Genesis.

                                Mango definitely put up a heck of a fight though, you have to give him props for that. Despite going into losers early
                                courtesy of Axe, he gave everyone the show of a lifetime, only dropping 2 games in 4 sets leading up to Armada. Short of
                                Mango completing his run, Genesis 3 top 8 was everything we had hoped for and more.

                        <p>
                            Genesis 3 was amazing, and definitely ranks among the greatest tournament of all time. Being there in person was an amazing
                            experience, and I'm looking forward to the next national I'll go to. For Melee as a whole, this tournament was important. As
                            the biggest independently organized smash event, it showed that we can hang with the top in eSports, and showed how far melee
                            as a game has come from it's humble beginnings. Just as tournaments were starting to seem stale with Hbox and Armada meeting
                            in every grand finals, Mango comes along with his ludicrous Fox play and gives life to the scene. Armada's Fox has been shown
                            to not be as bulletproof as we thought, having to rely on Peach to get the win. What all of this spells for the months to come,
                            I can't say, but I'm beyond excited.
